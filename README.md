# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In this Project I have used [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for fetching API [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) and [React-icon](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for icon.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `netlify link`

I have deployed this Project using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
